# React Weather App

This application was created in order to study technologies such as React and Tailwind, which ultimately allowed us to strengthen practical knowledge.

### Problem:
At the moment, the application does not have an <b><i>adaptive layout</b></i> (for mobile devices and tablets), but it will appear soon.
