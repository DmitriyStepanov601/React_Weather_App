## Project Description

This application allows you to get information about the current weather in the city specified by the user, as well as using the geographical location to show the user the weather in his city.

In addition, it displays information for 5 days with an indication of the time in the interval of 5 hours.

## API

Data on meteorological conditions are obtained through the use of a free API from the website: https://openweathermap.org/api
